            <p>
            I am a social worker deeply passionate about front-end development, having spent the past four months learning its fundamentals. Through this journey, I have gained valuable skills in creating intuitive and accessible user interfaces that can help bridge digital divides and empower underserved communities. I am committed to using these new skills to drive social change by developing platforms and tools that amplify voices, provide critical resources, and foster greater connection and support within marginalized groups. I believe technology can be a catalyst for social good, and I am excited to contribute to meaningful change through innovation..</p>
